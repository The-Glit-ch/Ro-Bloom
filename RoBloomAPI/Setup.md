# Setup

Setting up the API is easy. All you need to do is import the two scripts into your game

You then want to make sure the scripts are properly linked

Ex:
![alt text](https://github.com/The-Glit-ch/Ro-Bloom/blob/[branch]/image1.jpg?raw=true) --Link here

![alt text](https://github.com/The-Glit-ch/Ro-Bloom/blob/[branch]/image1.jpg?raw=true) --Link here again

As you can see I imported the two scripts and I parented the "Ro-Bloom Services" script to the "Ro-Bloom API". I then linked the "Ro-Bloom Services" script
